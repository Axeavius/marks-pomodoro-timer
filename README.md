# Mark's Pomodoro Timer

### What it is

**Mark's Pomodoro Timer** is a simple Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application that utilizes the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) to help you efficiently complete tasks in a specific amount of time. Every task is given a 25-minute timer, and every task is followed up by a 5-minute break. After 4 tasks have been completed, you take a longer 15-minute break. That's it!

### What it does

This app was designed to be easy and intuitive to use. The timer automatically switches between Pomoodoro and Break Time, and the task list is pre-populated with 4 tasks. If 4 isn't enough for you, just click the Add New Task button as many times as you need. At the end of any timer, a visual overlay will appear and a gentle audio notification will play. Also, the selected task will automatically be marked as completed. 

The timer controls are also simple and straightforward: 

 * Play/Pause Timer - start/pause any timer
 * Next Task - stop any active timer and select next task in the task list
 * Reset Timer - stop any active timer and reset it to starting value
